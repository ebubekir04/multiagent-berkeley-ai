# multiagent-berkeley-ai

Implementation of multi-agent algorithms and strategies as part of the Berkeryl AI project. Developed for an Artificial Intelligence course at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Computer Science major.

## Project Overview

This repository contains implementations and experiments with multi-agent systems, focusing on:
- Cooperative and adversarial agent behaviors
- Multi-agent pathfinding and decision-making
- Classic AI scenarios such as Pacman (ghosts vs. agent)

The project demonstrates how intelligent agents interact, collaborate, or compete to achieve their goals, featuring both implemented algorithms and example environments.

## Collaboration & Credits

This project was a **collaborative effort** by Ebubekir Kahriman and Mohamed Amine Zarouali.  
Originally developed together for a course at VUB, further updated here for portfolio and academic purposes.
